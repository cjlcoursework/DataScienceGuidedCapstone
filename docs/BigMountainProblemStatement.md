# Big Mountain Resort  

## Context
- Operating costs are up at Big Mountain 
- The operating cost of adding a new ski Lift have accentuated that issue
- It's unspoken, but the presumption is that we are concerned with the overall effect on profit
- We can either bring operating cost down, or increase revenue to improve profit
- A working hypothesis is that in general we are not pricing our facilities the best way to increase revenue 
- Looking at it this way, our investment strategy is also highly contingent on our ability to price our offerings

- Our current pricing strategy has been to charge a premium above the average price resorts i our market segment

- Basing our pricing on just the market average does not provide the business with a
good sense of how important some facilities are compared to others

## Criteria for Success
- Provide guidance on how to select a 'better' pricing model - focused on ticket pricing.
  - What parameters most likely affect our pricing strategy? 
  - What makes one facility more valuable, or 'worth' more than another?
  - Stated question:  how can we select 'better' pricing?  What should we base pricing on?  
  - What attributes of a facility support different pricing models?

## Analysis
- We need to better understand our 'levers' with respect to pricing
  - what investments increase revenue, which do not
  - how should we price our offering
- How can we determine pricing?
- The focus on op cost as well as investment 
- How can we invest properly without negatively impacting profit

## Scope of solution space
- This study will focus understanding causation and correlations of pricing data from across the US for which we have pricing information.

## Constraints
- It's unclear now how complete that data is, or how much effort and time it will take to improve the data
- It's unclear whether the data will provide actionable insights
- There's little marketing information available - we may be able to infer some information from the pricing models of other resorts in our segment.
